title: Are You a Student in Tech? This Blog Is for You.
brief: I'm Wal Wal, a student developer navigating the modern world. You're also someone in tech or design - looks like we have something in common.

COVID-19 is keeping all of us at home, racial tensions are at an all-time high, and getting a job at Facebook is no longer the pinnacle of success.

I don't know about you, but I feel like the modern world on its own is more difficult to navigate than it's ever been. On top of being in a field where every decision feels like it's all or nothing, I feel like us tech students don't have it easy.

How am I handling things? Probably not much different than you are.

Reading, anime, Twitter, and programming have been ways that I've been keeping myself busy while I watch summer escape my grasp and wait for Carleton University to hold me hostage.

Despite all of the despondency, I've managed to gather my attention to a new hobby that I think you and I will both enjoy.

# Introducing: The Blog

Quarantine has given me a lot of time to think. I've been left with so many thoughts and ideas, but with a fraction of the outlets I once had.

My goal with this blog is to have a place for me to lay my thoughts and experiences out into the world, while also generating discussion on topics that are relevant to us as students.

I'm also trying to make a habit of documenting my life more. One's memory is only so reliable.

# What's in it for you?

Lots! I'll be telling the stories of my various experiences, things like [CUSEC](http://2020.cusec.net/#/) or hackathons that I attend. Perhaps I'll even talk about the job search process in the tech industry.

I have a post in the works that talks about why I think working at FAANG companies isn't the only path to success. You can expect more opinion/discussion pieces like this, where I'll open up discussion on Twitter.

I also plan to share programming wisdom through some tutorials. Ideally, it will be the stuff that you don't get to learn through school. I'm a web developer, so you can expect that they will be focused on web development.

Lastly, Digital Privacy is becoming more and more relevant in the modern day. With the frequent data breaches and surveillance capitalism being a reality, I believe it's in our hands as the newest kids on the block to educate our communities on how to protect our data, and support [companies that are taking steps to be more transparent](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21346390/tiktok-algorithm-moderation-policy-transparency-china). So be prepared to learn ways for you and your friends to control your data and take back your privacy.
